# file-generator

## Usage

1. copy the script into it's own directory (preferably into a separate directory than your source directory)
2. change the `TARGET` variable to point to your source directory
3. Create a directory named `file` inside the source directory
4. Run the script

## Note:

Since the script compiles and generates output for each .cpp file, make sure the programs do not require any input from stdin. If they do, redirect the input inside the script
